# Data Analysis with Python portfolio

This portfolio contains five projects that are part of the "Data Analysis with Python" [certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/wyvkan/data-analysis-with-python-v7) by freeCodeCamp. 


### Project 1: Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
In this project, I created a function using **Numpy** to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

### Project 2: Demographic Data Analyze
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of demographic data using **Pandas** to answer the following questions:
* How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? 
* What is the average age of men?
* What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
* What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
* What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
* What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
* What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
* What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
* Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

### Project 3: Medical Data Visualizer
In this project, I employed **matplotlib**, **seaborn** and **pandas** to visualize and make calculations from medical examination data.

### Project 4: Page View Time Series Visualizer
In this project, I used **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to visualize time-series data and to identify patterns and trends.

### Project 5: Sea Level Predictor
In this project, I used **Pandas**, **matplotlib**, **scipy.stats** to visualize and predict sea level based on a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880.
